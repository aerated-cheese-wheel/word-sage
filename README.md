Hi! This is a project I do **for fun** and work on when I have some freetime.
Made with love, and some is from _ChatGPT_.
If you'd like to help, I'd love to have some help.

In essence, the script uses _Wikipedia_ to provide the text/.html files for the GUI viewer, and it is **_not lisenced_**
**Goal:** Get on the Debian package list
Thanks,
